However, finding an adequate step size for an arbitrary target distribution can be a difficult task and even the best step size can perform poorly in specific regions of the space when the target distribution is sufficiently complex. To resolve this issue we introduce autoMALA, a new Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm based on MALA that automatically sets its step size at each iteration based on the local geometry of the target distribution. We prove that autoMALA has the correct invariant distribution, despite continual automatic adjustments of the step size. Our experiments demonstrate that autoMALA is competitive with related state-of-the-art MCMC methods, in terms of the number of log density evaluations per effective sample, and it outperforms state-of-the-art samplers on targets with varying geometries. Furthermore, we find that autoMALA tends to find step sizes comparable to optimally-tuned MALA when a fixed step size suffices for the whole domain.","tags":null,"title":"autoMALA: Locally adaptive Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nikola Surjanovic","Miguel Biron-Lattes","Paul Tiede","Saifuddin Syed","Trevor Campbell","Alexandre Bouchard-Côté"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1692316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692316800,"objectID":"0929ac644e88e8ac806551d4aa4854d5","permalink":"https://saifsyed.com/publication/pigeons/","publishdate":"2023-08-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pigeons/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce a software package, Pigeons.jl, that provides a way to leverage distributed computation to obtain samples from complicated probability distributions, such as multimodal posteriors arising in Bayesian inference and high-dimensional distributions in statistical mechanics.

In this work, we study a relaxation of exchangeability in which this invariance need not hold precisely. We introduce the notion of local exchangeability -- where swapping data associated with nearby covariates causes a bounded change in the distribution. We prove that locally exchangeable processes correspond to independent observations from an underlying measure-valued stochastic process. Using this main probabilistic result, we show that the local empirical measure of a finite collection of observations provides an approximation of the underlying measure-valued process and Bayesian posterior predictive distributions. The paper concludes with applications of the main theoretical results to a model from Bayesian nonparametrics and covariate-dependent permutation tests.","tags":[],"title":"Local Exchangeability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christopher Williams","Fabian Falck","George Deligiannidis","Chris Holmes","Arnaud Doucet","Saifuddin Syed"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1684108800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684108800,"objectID":"ab69748f956d5fce7f9212b592d1cce9","permalink":"https://saifsyed.com/publication/u-nets/","publishdate":"2023-05-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/u-nets/","section":"publication","summary":"U-Nets are a go-to, state-of-the-art neural architecture across numerous tasks for continuous signals on a square such as images and Partial Differential Equations (PDE), however their design and architecture is understudied.

We present theoretical results which characterise the role of the encoder and decoder in a U-Net, their high-resolution scaling limits and their conjugacy to ResNets via preconditioning. We propose Multi-ResNets, U-Nets with a simplified, wavelet-based encoder without learnable parameters. Further, we show how to design novel U-Net architectures which encode function constraints, natural bases, or the geometry of the data. In diffusion models, our framework enables us to identify that high-frequency information is dominated by noise exponentially faster, and show how U-Nets with average pooling exploit this. In our experiments, we demonstrate how Multi-ResNets achieve competitive and often superior performance compared to classical U-Nets in image segmentation, PDE surrogate modelling, and generative modelling with diffusion models. Our U-Net framework paves the way to study the theoretical properties of U-Nets and design natural, scalable neural architectures for a multitude of problems beyond the square.","tags":null,"title":"A Unified Framework for U-Net Design and Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Researchers at Georgia Tech used NRPT to statistically identify gerrymandering in Georgia’s 2021 congressional districting plan.\n","date":1665964800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665964800,"objectID":"c07f7ab11323548a3bc2af6cac80006b","permalink":"https://saifsyed.com/project/georgia/","publishdate":"2022-10-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/georgia/","section":"project","summary":"Georgia Tech used NRPT to statistically identify gerrymandering in Georgia's 2021 congressional districting plan.","tags":null,"title":"Discover gerrymandering in Georgia's 2021 congressional districting plan","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663583400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663583400,"objectID":"f106b19cc2ef3e5af632474c65260726","permalink":"https://saifsyed.com/talk/harvard-university-black-hole-institute-seminar/","publishdate":"2022-09-19T10:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/harvard-university-black-hole-institute-seminar/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Harvard University Black Hole Institute Seminar","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1656433800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656433800,"objectID":"9fc6292031ad864db2ba0affaf1d8945","permalink":"https://saifsyed.com/talk/isba-2022-world-meeting/","publishdate":"2022-06-28T16:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/isba-2022-world-meeting/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"ISBA 2022 World Meeting","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655908200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655908200,"objectID":"9bd15a5e14bd22cd9b1d936a68614900","permalink":"https://saifsyed.com/talk/universite-de-montreal-statlab-seminar/","publishdate":"2022-06-22T14:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/universite-de-montreal-statlab-seminar/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Université de Montréal Statlab Seminar","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655305200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655305200,"objectID":"bee19e057c04f7661d40f29e8d7a454a","permalink":"https://saifsyed.com/talk/cosines-blue-sky-kitchen-2022/","publishdate":"2022-06-15T15:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/cosines-blue-sky-kitchen-2022/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"CoSInES Blue Sky Kitchen 2022","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1653667200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653667200,"objectID":"3e0981640d748fe3fa30210f73a5d494","permalink":"https://saifsyed.com/talk/university-of-oxford-oxcsml-seminar/","publishdate":"2022-05-27T16:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/university-of-oxford-oxcsml-seminar/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"University of Oxford OxCSML Seminar","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) used non-reversible parallel tempering to generate the photograph of Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.\n","date":1652313600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652313600,"objectID":"19d29f36e4d6fd2f43c568fcaa5bc614","permalink":"https://saifsyed.com/project/eht_sagittariusa/","publishdate":"2022-05-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/eht_sagittariusa/","section":"project","summary":"The Event Horizon Telescope collaboration used NRPT to image Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.","tags":null,"title":"Generating first image of Sagittarius A*","type":"project"},{"authors":["Nikola Surjanovic","Saifuddin Syed","Trevor Campbell","Alexandre Bouchard-Côté"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1651363200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651363200,"objectID":"e598bf4470acab27f5d25dc8cb17fc00","permalink":"https://saifsyed.com/publication/pt_variational/","publishdate":"2022-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pt_variational/","section":"publication","summary":"Sampling from complex target distributions is a challenging task fundamental to Bayesian inference. Parallel tempering (PT) addresses this problem by constructing a Markov chain on the expanded state space of a sequence of distributions interpolating between the posterior distribution and a fixed reference distribution, which is typically chosen to be the prior. However, in the typical case where the prior and posterior are nearly mutually singular, PT methods are computationally prohibitive. In this work we address this challenge by constructing a generalized annealing path connecting the posterior to an adaptively tuned variational reference. The reference distribution is tuned to minimize the forward (inclusive) KL divergence to the posterior distribution using a simple, gradient-free moment-matching procedure. We show that our adaptive procedure converges to the forward KL minimizer, and that the forward KL divergence serves as a good proxy to a previously developed measure of PT performance. We also show that in the large-data limit in typical Bayesian models, the proposed method improves in performance, while traditional PT deteriorates arbitrarily. Finally, we introduce PT with two references -- one fixed, one variational -- with a novel split annealing path that ensures stable variational reference adaptation. The paper concludes with experiments that demonstrate the large empirical gains achieved by our method in a wide range of realistic Bayesian inference scenarios.","tags":[],"title":"Parallel tempering with a variational reference","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1649815200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649815200,"objectID":"7e65f1dfa3c4646f407efa7798184464","permalink":"https://saifsyed.com/talk/qut-centre-for-data-science-early-career-bayes-seminar-series/","publishdate":"2022-04-13T02:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/qut-centre-for-data-science-early-career-bayes-seminar-series/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"QUT Centre for Data Science: Early Career Bayes Seminar Series","type":"event"},{"authors":["Saifuddin Syed"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1648771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648771200,"objectID":"0f40cf545adf79432be77d9037b7794b","permalink":"https://saifsyed.com/publication/thesis/","publishdate":"2022-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"Parallel tempering (PT) methods are a popular class of Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes used to sample complex high-dimensional probability distributions.

You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you’ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
