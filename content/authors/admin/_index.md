I am a postdoctoral assistant in computational statistics and statistical machine learning at the University of Oxford Department of Statistics, supervised by {{< staticref "https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/" "newtab" >}}Arnaud Doucet{{< /staticref >}}. Before this, I completed a Ph.D. in Statistics at the University of British Columbia under {{< staticref "https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/" "newtab" >}}Alexandre Bouchard-Côté{{< /staticref >}}. I recently joined the next generation Event Horizon Telescope ({{< staticref "https://www.ngeht.org/" "newtab" >}}ngEHT{{< /staticref >}}) collaboration to help design algorithms to tackle statistical challenges when modelling and imaging supermassive black holes.

My research aims to design algorithms for solving Bayesian inference problems applied to computational sciences. I am interested in developing mathematically grounded, general-purpose algorithms that can efficiently scale to modern computing resources. My work is interdisciplinary and lies at the interface between probability theory, statistical physics, machine learning, and differential geometry.
