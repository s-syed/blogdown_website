I am a Florence Nightingale Bicentennial Fellow in computational statistics and machine learning at the University of Oxford's Department of Statistics, where I am also a member of the Algorithms and Inference Working Group for the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope {{< staticref "https://www.ngeht.org/" "newtab" >}}(ngEHT).{{< /staticref >}}. Prior to this role, I completed a postdoctoral fellowship under the guidance of {{< staticref "https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/" "newtab" >}}Arnaud Doucet{{< /staticref >}} and earned my PhD under the supervision of {{< staticref "https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~bouchard/" "newtab" >}}Alexandre Bouchard-Côté.{{< /staticref >}}. My doctoral thesis won the {{< staticref "https://ssc.ca/en/publications/ssc-liaison/vol-37-2-april-2023/winner-pierre-robillard-award" "newtab" >}}Pierre Robillard Award{{< /staticref >}} from the Statistical Society of Canada (SSC), the {{< staticref "https://caims.ca/award/cecil-graham-doctoral-dissertation-award/" "newtab" >}}Cecil Graham Doctoral Dissertation Award{{< /staticref >}} from the Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Society (CAIMS), and the {{< staticref "https://bayesian.org/project/savage-award/" "newtab" >}}Savage Award (Honourable Mention) {{< /staticref >}} for theory and methods from the International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA). 


My research involves designing scalable and robust algorithms for Bayesian inference with scientific applications in mind. If you have a cool, computationally challenging problem reach out!
