I am a postdoctoral assistant in computational statistics and statistical machine learning at the University of Oxford Department of Statistics, supervised by {{< staticref "https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/" "newtab" >}}Arnaud Doucet{{< /staticref >}}. I recently joined the next generation Event Horizon Telescope {{< staticref "https://www.ngeht.org/" "newtab" >}}(ngEHT){{< /staticref >}} collaboration to help tackle computational statistical challenges when modelling and imaging supermassive black holes. Prior to this, I completed a PhD in Statistics under {{< staticref "https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/" "newtab" >}}Alexandre Bouchard-Côté{{< /staticref >}}, where we designed a non-reversible variant of a popular algorithm in statistics and physics called parallel tempering. See the {{< staticref "/#projects">}}applications{{< /staticref >}} section for recent examples of non-reversible parallel tempering being used at scale.


My research aims to design algorithms for solving Bayesian inference problems in the applied sciences. I am interested in developing mathematically grounded, general-purpose algorithms that can efficiently scale to modern computing resources. My work is interdisciplinary and lies at the interface between probability theory, physics, machine learning, and differential geometry.
