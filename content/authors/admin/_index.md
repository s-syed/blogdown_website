I am a postdoctoral assistant in computational statistics and statistical machine learning at the University of Oxford Department of Statistics, supervised by {{< staticref "https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/" "newtab" >}}Arnaud Doucet{{< /staticref >}}. I Recently joined the next generation Event Horizon Telescope ({{< staticref "https://www.ngeht.org/" "newtab" >}}ngEHT{{< /staticref >}}) collaboration to help tackle computational statistical challenges when modelling and imaging supermassive black holes.

Prior to this, I completed a PhD in Statistics under {{< staticref "https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/" "newtab" >}}Alexandre Bouchard-Côté{{< /staticref >}}, where I studied a non-reversible variant of a popular algorithm used in computational statistics and physics called ‘parallel tempering’. We showed that the non-reversible parallel tempering (NRPT) dominates the traditionally used reversible counterpart, can scale to GPUs and designed an efficient algorithm to tune it optimally.

My research aims to design algorithms for solving Bayesian inference problems in the applied sciences. I am interested in developing mathematically grounded, general-purpose algorithms that can efficiently scale to modern computing resources. My work is interdisciplinary and lies at the interface between probability theory, physics, machine learning, and differential geometry.”
