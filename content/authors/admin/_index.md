I am a Florence Nightingale Fellow in computational statistics and machine learning in Oxford's Department of Statistics, and am actively involved in the Algorithms and Inference Working Group for the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT). Before assuming this role, I completed a postdoctoral fellowship under the guidance of {{< staticref "https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/" "newtab" >}}Arnaud Doucet{{< /staticref >}} and earned my PhD under the supervision of {{< staticref "https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~bouchard/" "newtab" >}}Alexandre Bouchard-Côté{{< /staticref >}}.

I am passionate about developing mathematically robust and scalable algorithms to tackle complex Bayesian inference challenges in scientific applications. My approach employs a technique known as "annealing," which addresses intractable problems by progressively transforming solutions derived from a more manageable reference problem. My research draws inspiration from diverse fields, including stochastic analysis, statistical physics, and differential geometry. Please refer to the {{< staticref "#projects" >}}applications{{< /staticref >}} section to explore recent large-scale implementations of my work.
