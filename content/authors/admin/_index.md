I am a Florence Nightingale Bicentennial Fellow in computational statistics and machine learning at the University of Oxford's Department of Statistics, where I am also a member of the Algorithms and Inference Working Group for the Generation Event Horizon Telescope {{< staticref "https://www.ngeht.org/" "newtab" >}}(ngEHT).{{< /staticref >}} Prior to this role, I completed a postdoctoral fellowship under the guidance of {{< staticref "https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/" "newtab" >}}Arnaud Doucet{{< /staticref >}} and earned my PhD under the supervision of {{< staticref "https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~bouchard/" "newtab" >}}Alexandre Bouchard-Côté.{{< /staticref >}} I am honored to have been awarded the 2023 Pierre Robillard award by the Statistical Society of Canada {{< staticref "https://ssc.ca/en" "newtab" >}}(SSC),{{< /staticref >}} and I am also a finalist for the 2023 Savage award by the International Society of Bayesian Analysis {{< staticref "https://bayesian.org/" "newtab" >}}(ISBA).{{< /staticref >}}


My research focus is on developing mathematically rigorous and scalable algorithms for Bayesian inference in scientific applications. My approach is centered around the use of "annealing" techniques, which involve progressively transforming solutions from a more manageable reference problem to address intractable problems. I draw inspiration from a range of fields, including stochastic analysis, statistical physics, and differential geometry. Please refer to my {{< staticref "#publications" >}}publications{{< /staticref >}} section for an up-to-date list of my papers, and my {{< staticref "#projects" >}}applications{{< /staticref >}} section for recent large-scale applications of my work.
