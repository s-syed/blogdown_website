I am a Florence Nightingale Bicentennial Fellow in computational statistics and machine learning at the University of Oxford's Department of Statistics, where I am also a member of the Algorithms and Inference Working Group for the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope {{< staticref "https://www.ngeht.org/" "newtab" >}}(ngEHT).{{< /staticref >}} Prior to this role, I completed a postdoctoral fellowship under the guidance of {{< staticref "https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/" "newtab" >}}Arnaud Doucet{{< /staticref >}} and earned my PhD under the supervision of {{< staticref "https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~bouchard/" "newtab" >}}Alexandre Bouchard-Côté{{< /staticref >}}.  


My research lies at the interface of probability theory, statistical physics and differential geometry with the aim of to designing scalable and robust algorithms for Bayesian inference. I am particularly interested in "annealing algorithms" such as parallel tempering and sequential Monte Carlo, which involve progressively transforming solutions from a tractable reference problem into solutions to an intractable target problem. My work on non-reversible parallel tempering received this year's {{< staticref "https://ssc.ca/en/publications/ssc-liaison/vol-37-2-april-2023/winner-pierre-robillard-award" "newtab" >}}Pierre Robillard Award{{< /staticref >}} from the SSC, the {{< staticref "https://caims.ca/award/cecil-graham-doctoral-dissertation-award/" "newtab" >}}Cecil Graham Doctoral Dissertation Award{{< /staticref >}} from the CAIMS, and is a finalist for the {{< staticref "https://bayesian.org/project/savage-award/" "newtab" >}}Savage Award{{< /staticref >}} for theory and methods from ISBA.
