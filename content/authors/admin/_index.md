I am a Florence Nightingale Bicentennial Fellow in computational statistics and machine learning at the University of Oxford's Department of Statistics, where I am also a member of the Algorithms and Inference Working Group for the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope {{< staticref "https://www.ngeht.org/" "newtab" >}}(ngEHT).{{< /staticref >}} Prior to this role, I completed a postdoc supervised by {{< staticref "https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/" "newtab" >}}Arnaud Doucet{{< /staticref >}} and a PhD supervised by {{< staticref "https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~bouchard/" "newtab" >}}Alexandre Bouchard-Côté.{{< /staticref >}} 


My research involves developing robust and scalable algorithms for statistical inference and generative modelling, with scientific applications in mind. My research has received numerous national and internation awards including the {{< staticref "https://ssc.ca/en/publications/ssc-liaison/vol-37-2-april-2023/winner-pierre-robillard-award" "newtab" >}}Pierre Robillard Award{{< /staticref >}}, the {{< staticref "https://caims.ca/award/cecil-graham-doctoral-dissertation-award/" "newtab" >}}Cecil Graham Doctoral Dissertation Award{{< /staticref >}}, and the honourable mention of the {{< staticref "https://bayesian.org/project/savage-award/" "newtab" >}}Savage Award {{< /staticref >}} for Bayesian theory and methods.
