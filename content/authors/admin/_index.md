I am a postdoctoral assistant in computational statistics and statistical machine learning at the University of Oxford Department of Statistics, supervised by {{< staticref "https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/" "newtab" >}}Arnaud Doucet{{< /staticref >}}. I recently joined the next generation Event Horizon Telescope {{< staticref "https://www.ngeht.org/" "newtab" >}}(ngEHT){{< /staticref >}} collaboration to help tackle computational statistical challenges when modelling and imaging supermassive black holes. Before this, I completed a PhD in Statistics under {{< staticref "https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/" "newtab" >}}Alexandre Bouchard-Côté{{< /staticref >}} at the University of British Columbia Department of Statistics.

For my PhD thesis, I studied a non-reversible variant of a popular algorithm in computational statistics and physics called parallel tempering. We showed that the non-reversible parallel tempering (NRPT) dominates the traditionally used reversible counterpart, can be efficiently tuned and scales to GPUs. See the applications section for recent examples of NRPT used at scale.


My research aims to design algorithms for solving Bayesian inference problems in the applied sciences. I am interested in developing mathematically grounded, general-purpose algorithms that can efficiently scale to modern computing resources. My work is interdisciplinary and lies at the interface between probability theory, physics, machine learning, and differential geometry.
