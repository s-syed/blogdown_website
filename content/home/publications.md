Many of the state-of-the-art algorithms in statistics, and machine learning, utilize a technique called annealing, which involves making inferences from an intractable target problem by incrementally deforming solutions from a tractable reference problem. I'm developing a unifying framework to study annealing and explore the connections between different annealing algorithms in the MCMC, SMC, variational inference, diffusion models, normalizing flows, and optimal transport literature.
