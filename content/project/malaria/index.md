TAE Technologies, Inc. {{< staticref "https://tae.com/" "newtab" >}}(TAE){{< /staticref >}} and Google research used NRPT in conjuction with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to tackle ill-conditioned Bayesian inverse problems that arise when modelling the plasma dynamics in the world largest field-reversed configuration (FCR) nuclear fusion reactor.
